# SmartDesign
This is a project I'm currently working on with fellow developer Kiran Kunigiri. It consists of an iOS and Web platform both of which are currently in
development. Android is currently untouched. 

SmartDesign, which is currently the project's placeholder name, saves designers
the trouble of having to document constructive feedback they get from various 
people on the internet. 

It is a social network designed for one purpose, which is to keep track of the 
number of people that like each version of your project. Simply log in and post
your project, which will appear in each user's view. Other users can see the different versions you have posted and vote for the best one, along with being able to comment on your work. Unlike social networking sites such as Facebook and Google Plus, SmartDesign allows you to log in with various account types, and does not force you to have to create a new account on yet another social network. We are compatible with Google Accounts but will also have options available for other networks. 
You can also create a new account, authenticated by email, if you would like.

Stay tuned for more updates :)
